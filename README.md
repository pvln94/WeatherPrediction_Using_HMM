# WeatherPrediction_Using_HMM

I made a website that predicts the nextday's weather in Hyderabad based on previous days weather report.
This website predicts the Precipitation that weather.

I used HMM(Hidden Markov Model) to do the prediction.

Dataset:
For the local Hyderabad Airport's Weather dataset, used [website](https://meteostat.net/en/) which have data from 2024-01-01 to 2024-10-12 (Hourly).
Note: I was only able to access that data due to restrictions.
